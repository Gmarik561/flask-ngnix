Regarding Keda, it's a Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaling tool. It scales applications based on metrics from various sources. To integrate Keda, you would typically set up a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using tools like kops, kubeadm, or managed services like AKS, EKS, GKE), then install Keda into the cluster using Helm or other deployment methods. Once Keda is set up, you can define scalers (like Prometheus, Azure Monitor, RabbitMQ, etc.) and scale your applications based on those metrics dynamically.
